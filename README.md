This is a collection of random, personal projects that might be engineering related to computer science related.

What is shown:

1. Water Bottle Project: A CAD representation of the water bottle I use everday. Modeled of the thermoflask.
Status: Not finished 

2. Programming Lab Assignments: A bunch of projects from my time taking Programming Lab, which shows Java programs that I have coded using skeletons provided by the instructor
Status: finished

=================================================  <br />
What is to come (randome ideas):

1. A 3D physics calculator based off of Soccer Sim located in pw/programming lab/ Ball, SoccerSim,Timer (and maybe riemann sum calculator for accuracy) coded in java
 ~ this would mainly be for projectile motion, however I hope to eventually include tension, dynamics, and any other basic level physics.
 
2. A CAD part to hold a nintendo switch and a nintendo switch game controller

3. greatness
