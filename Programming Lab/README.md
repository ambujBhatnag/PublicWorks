Ambuj's Programming Lab Java Assignments 
=================

This directory showcases programs created in Java that do not use any sort of data structures or algorithms.

Preface:
These programs were created when I took the "Programming Lab" class at Loyola Marymount University, which is required to take before Data Structures and Algorithms for majors and minors. This class provided a better understanding of Java for me as a whole. The code has been academically reviewed. I believe the programs created in the class show my proficiency in creating object-oriented Java programs.

WHAT IS SHOWN:
1) Calendar Stuff and Count the Days: Programs that work in conjuction with each other to compare dates and get information about said dates. 

2) Dice, Die, Highroll: Programs that work with each other to roll dice...yeah.

3) Riemann: A basic riemann sum calculator that can do basic functions: (sin, cosine, etc)

4) Ball, SoccerSim: Programs that imitate a ball moving on a soccer field
