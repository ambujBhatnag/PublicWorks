This directory showcases programs created with java that do not use any sort of data structures or algorithms.
==================
Preface:
These programs were created when I took the "Programming Lab" class at Loyola Marymount University, which is required to take before Data Structures and Algorithsm for majors and minors. This class provided a better understanding of Java for me as a whole. The code has been academically reviewed. I believe the programs created in the class show my proficiency in creating object-oriented java programs.
==================
WHAT IS SHOWN:
1) Calendar Stuff and Count the Days: Programs that work in conjuction with each other to create objects that store dates and can be compared to one another. CountTheDays checks the amount of days between two dates. CalendarStuff has a lot of different functions, which include checking if the date given is valid, comparing two dates to eachother, checking if the year is leap, checking if two dates are the same, etc.
