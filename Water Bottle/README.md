==== CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON ====

This project shows a CAD representation of my thermoflask water bottle. A picture of the water bottle is on file as "WATERBOTTLESOURCE". 

Nomal PDFs have simple CAD pictures of the part.
PDF drawings (with DRAWING in the name) have a drawing of the part with relevant dimensions 

Because a simple thermoflask water bottle has a complex design, I have broken it down to into several parts:

1) Bottle Body: the part of the bottle that holds the actual water || done || pushed ||
2) Bottle Head: top part of the bottle where the lid is screwed on || done || pushed ||
3) Main Lid Body: Part of the lid that screws onto the Bottle Head, also includes the bore || done || not pushed ||
4) Lid Cap Holder: Part of the lid which holds the cap that screws onto the bore in place || done || not pushed ||
5) Lid Cap: screws into bore || not done || not pushed ||
6) Bottle Holder: mechanism attached to lid that can be used to hold the bottle || not done || not pushed ||


The fully assembled bottle can be seen in the FullBottleAssembly pdf, which is currently: NOT READY
